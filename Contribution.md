Wine Cellar Sample Application Using Django Backend
===================================================

About
=====
"Backbone Cellar" is a sample application built with [Backbone.js](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/).

This is an effort of rewriting the [wine cellar](http://coenraets.org/blog/2011/12/backbone-js-wine-cellar-tutorial-part-1-getting-stared/) application using a backend written in [Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.4/).
As needed, there is a clean API - written using [django-tastypie](http://django-tastypie.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).
Furthemore, it will be used [Require.js](http://requirejs.org) as an effort to implement a modular and organized [Backbone.js](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/).
